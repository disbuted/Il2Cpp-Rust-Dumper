# Il2Cpp-Rust-Dumper

This repository provides a simple automated workflow to run **[Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper)** on Unity il2cpp games and generate cleaned offset header files (`external_offsets.h` & `internal_offsets.h`) useful for game hacking/reverse engineering Unity il2cpp based games.

## Im too lazy to write a tutorial at this current moment in time.
Just make sure you have the Il2Cpp executable in the same directory as this project and run the python files in order!
